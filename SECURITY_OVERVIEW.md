# Multi-Tenant Security Implementation

## Row Level Security (RLS) Overview

AllTownDelivery implements comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure proper tenant isolation and data protection across the multi-tenant platform.

## Protected Tables

### 1. tenants
**Protection Level**: Tenant-scoped access
- Users can only view their own tenant data (plan_type, billing_status, subscription info)
- Only tenant admins can update tenant settings
- Contains sensitive subscription data: stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, plan_type, billing_status

### 2. user_profiles  
**Protection Level**: User-scoped access
- Users can only view, insert, and update their own profile
- Prevents cross-tenant user data access
- Contains personal data: email, phone, addresses, role information

### 3. customer_loyalty_accounts
**Protection Level**: User-scoped access with tenant context
- Users can only view their own loyalty accounts across all tenants
- Supports cross-tenant loyalty tracking while maintaining privacy
- Contains loyalty points, delivery history, free credits per tenant

### 4. delivery_requests
**Protection Level**: User-scoped access
- Users can only view their own delivery requests
- Drivers/admins can view requests within their tenant
- Contains delivery details, payment information, customer data

### 5. business_settings
**Protection Level**: Open read access for public business discovery
- Allows cross-tenant browsing for customer service discovery
- Contains business hours, service areas, pricing (public information)
- Write access restricted to tenant admins

## Security Architecture: Option C (Hybrid Approach)

- **Strict isolation**: user_profiles, customer_loyalty_accounts, delivery_requests, tenants
- **Cross-tenant access**: business_settings (for service discovery)
- **Customer flow**: Customers can browse all delivery services but have separate loyalty accounts per tenant

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Data Privacy**: Customer personal data isolated per user
2. **Tenant Security**: Business subscription/billing data protected 
3. **Service Discovery**: Customers can find services across tenants
4. **Loyalty Flexibility**: Separate loyalty tracking per business relationship
5. **Admin Controls**: Tenant admins control their business data only

## Plan-Based Feature Controls

The tenants table plan_type field enables future subscription-based feature restrictions:
- Basic: Standard delivery features
- Premium: Advanced analytics, custom domains
- Enterprise: White-label, API access, multiple locations

Future implementation will check user's tenant plan_type before enabling premium features.
